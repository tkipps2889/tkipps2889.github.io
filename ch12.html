    <h1>Chapter 12: Models of Computation</h1>
    <h2>Student: Tobias Kipps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>What is the purpose of a model?<br>To allow for study of something without needing to directly study the real thing</li>
        <li>List four phenomena of a model:<ol>
            <li>Captures the important properties of the real thing</li>
            <li>Usually different scale from the real thing</li>
            <li>Omits some details of the real thing</li>
            <li>Lacks the full functionality of the real thing</li>
        </ol></li>
        <li>List four things a computer agent should be able to do:<ol>
            <li>Accept input</li>
            <li>Store and retrieve information in memory</li>
            <li>Take actions according to algorthm instructions</li>
            <li>Produce output</li>
        </ol></li>
        <li>List four characteristics of an algorith:<ol>
            <li>Is a well-ordered collection</li>
            <li>Consists of unambiguous and effectively computable operations</li>
            <li>Halts in a finite amount of time</li>
            <li>Produces a result</li>
        </ol></li>
        <li>What is the "halting problem" with regards to an uncomputable problem?<br>An issue where the sequence of instructions continues forever.</li>
    </ol>

    
    <h1>Chapter 13: Simulation and Modeling</h1>
    <p>Term definitions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Scientific Method: Observe, form hypothesis, test hypothesis, repeat</li>
        <li>Computational Model: A model simulated via a set of algorithmic procedures</li>
        <li>Discrete Event Simulation: Modeling the behavior of a system only at a finite set of times</li>
    </ol>
    <p>List seven reasons to construct a simulation model</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Existence: Allows for experimenting on systems that do not yet exist.</li>
        <li>Physical Realization: Applicable for systems that cannot be represented by a physical model.</li>
        <li>Safety: It may be too dangerous to experiment on the actual system or a physical replica of it.</li>
        <li>Speed of construction: It is sometimes faster than building a physical model.</li>
        <li>Time scale: unlike with a physical model, the rate at which the system operates can be controlled.</li>
        <li>Ethics: Some physcial models present moral or ethical dilemmas which are not present with a simulated model.</li>
        <li>Ease of modification: Altering simulated models is much easier than reconstructing physical ones.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Illustris: "The Mother of All Computers"</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Illustris is a model of galaxy formation.</li>
        <li>Several scientific fields such as astrophysics, cosmology, and computer science were involved in its creation.</li>
        <li>Illustris simulates the process of galaxy formation and evolution of the universe.</li>
        <li>The project took five years to develop.</li>
        <li>Illustris simulates over 13.8 billion years of gallactic evolution.</li>
        <li>A supercomputer is an extremely powerful computer designed to perform complex calculations at very high speeds, often using thousands of processors working together.</li>
