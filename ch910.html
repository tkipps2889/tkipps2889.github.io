    <h1>Chapter 9: Introduction to High Level Languages</h1>
    <h2>Student: Tobias Kipps</h2>
    <p>List 4 disadvantages of using assembly language:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>More complex and difficult to write</li>
        <li>Not adaptable to different processors</li>
        <li>Less human-readable than high-level languages</li>
        <li>Longer development time</li>
    </ol>
    <p>List 4 expectations programmers have for writing programs in a high-level language:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Easily-readable code</li>
        <li>Automatic memory allocation and registry management</li>
        <li>Same code works on multiple systems</li>
        <li>Easier to deveop with</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Chapter 10: Tower of Babel: Programming Languages</h1>
    <p>Questions and Answers:</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> Why does the textbook refer to "the Tower of Babel" regarding computer languages?<br/>
    <b>A:</b> Because there are many different computer languages with thier own syntax and vocabulary, and code from one language is usually not understood by other languages.</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> Why isn't there just one computer language?<br/>
    <b>A:</b> Different languages were designed for different purposes and have different strengths or drawbacks.</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> Why didn't FORTRAN use the less than symbol for comparing two numbers?<br/>
    <b>A:</b> FORTRAN is an older language that uses syntax that would be considered unusual today</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> What was COBOL designed for?<br/>
    <b>A:</b> Buisness software (it stands for Common Buisness-Oriented Language, after all), particularly financial functions</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> What was C designed for?<br/>
    <b>A:</b> C was primarily designed for creating system-level software like drivers and operating systems.</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> What is the difference between C and C++<br/>
    <b>A:</b> C++ is an object-oriented language; it has classes and objects whereas C does not.</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> Who or what is Ada named for and why?<br/>
    <b>A:</b> It was named after Ada Lovelace, the first computer programmer.</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> What is a java "applet"?<br/>
    <b>A:</b> A small program written in java to perform a specific task, usually as part of a larger application.</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> How much does Python cost to download, install, and use?<br/>
    <b>A:</b> $0!</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> What is Microsoft.NET?<br/>
    <b>A:</b> An open-source software development platform created by Microsoft.</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> What is SQL and what is it used for?<br/>
    <b>A:</b> Structured Query Language is a data management language primarily used by databases.</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> What is R and what is it used for?<br/>
    <b>A:</b> R is another data-focused language used primarily for data analysis.</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> What is Go and what is it used for?<br/>
    <b>A:</b> Go is a general-purpose language designed to be easy to use, with a large library of common functions to make development more efficient</p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> What is Swift and what is it used for?<br/>
    <b>A:</b> Swift is a language used for development of IOS applications.</p>
    
    <p>Alternative programming paradigms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Functional Programming:</b> Function-centric paradigm that often stores functions in variables, uses them as arguments, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Logic Programming:</b> Paradigm that uses logical reasoning to adress a sequence of commands in order</li>
        <li><b>Parallel Programming:</b> Paradigm where multiple proccesses are carried out at the same time.</li>
    </ul>
